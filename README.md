# Description:

This application includes a front end and back end allowing a user to store notes with a format of "Title" and "Notes detail" in a .json file extension document. The front end presents a user with a home HTML page that can send the user to a notes page with entry available for the note details. Once the user saves the notes there is an API post call made to store the note to the .json file. Upon a user hitting the notes HTML page there is an API fetch route to retrieve the .json file data and display a list of existing notes via the note "Title".

Developers pulling this code to use locally will need to install the NPM package.json and also install required dependencis for Inquirer and Express modules.

This application is also up and running leveraging a 3rd party server through heroku making this application readily available through the URL: <url here>.
